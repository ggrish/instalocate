                                When you are forced to give up your seat because of overbooking, it’s called denied boarding. You are eligible to get on the spot compensation in case of denied boarding. Things to do in case of denied boarding:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Think before you accept the airline voucher. Because once you accept the voucher, you are volunteering to give up the seat and you are not eligible for claim.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Arrive on time for checkin: Apart from having a valid ticket to avail these rights, and you also should’ve arrived at the airport well in time (as required by the airline) for your check-in. Arriving in time is important! Remember, the passengers who come late, get bumped first.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Keep your paperwork handy: Never lose your boarding pass and receipt and ticket. They would be very important for availing your rights.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                If a passenger is placed in a lower class than that for which a ticket was purchased, the airline must refund 30/50/75% of the cost of the ticket depending upon the flight distance. If a passenger is placed in a higher class than that for which a ticket was purchased, the airline may not request any additional payment.
